* Fixed bug when obstacles move away from robot. Clear distances list when new distances arrive (also in case nothing is available for current link) to avoid no movement.
* - Renaming obstacle_marker_server for interactive obstacle
  - Now publishing all obstacle distances instead of the minimal distance only. Defined a MIN_DISTANCE for selection of data to publish (e.g. > than 0.5 m doesn't make sense for CA).
