0.6.8 (2015-06-17)
------------------

0.6.7 (2015-06-17)
------------------
* reduce output in limiters
* restructure namespaces for parameters of cartesian controllers
* - Instead of creating png create eps.
* - Added new damping method None
  - Added enum value to select damping None
  - Removed pure pointer usage and added boost::shared_ptr usage (which provides pointer management / ensure deletion of objects)
  - Removed unused includes
  - Renamings
* - Removed unnecessary ROS_INFO_STREAMs
  - Removed temporary variables for test code
* - Added debug code
  - Removed truncation
  - Removed unused members
* - Grouped limiters in one .h and one .cpp
  - Grouped damping_methods in one .h and one .cpp
  - Removed separate factories. Made SolverFactory generic by introducing template parameters.
  - Made usage of boost::shared_ptr instead of own pointer handling.
  - Adapted CMakeLists.txt according to changes.
  - Split parameter enforce_limits into enforce_pos_limits and enforce_vel_limits
* - To enforce limits for joint positions and velocities created new classes.
  - Additionally added parameter for keeping direction or not when enforcing limits.
  - Therefore removed normalize_velocities and enforce_limits from cob_twist_controller. Instead the new limiter_container is used.
  - Added new struct to provide cob_twist_controller params.
  - Removed debug code.
* - Take care: W^(1/2) * q_dot = weighted_pinv_J * x_dot -> One must consider the weighting!!!
  - Added script to check pseudo-inverse calculation.
* - Take care: W^(1/2) * q_dot = weighted_pinv_J * x_dot -> One must consider the weighting!!!
  - Added an octave script to verify the statement above.
* - Removed unnecessary file
* - Added doxygen comments
  - Activated graphviz for doc generation
  - Added const to method signatures to avoid undesired JntArray-Data change.
* - moved enfore_limits from augmented_solver to cob_twist_controller
  - Added a base case WeightedLeastNorm to constraint solvers
  Instantiated it acts like an unconstraint solver.
  - Renamed JointLimitAvoidanceSolver to WLN_JointLimitAvoidanceSolver
  - WLN_JointLimitAvoidanceSolver inherits from WeightedLeastNormSolver and implements calculate_weighting
* - moved enfore_limits from augmented_solver to cob_twist_controller
  - Added a base case WeightedLeastNorm to constraint solvers
  Instantiated it acts like an unconstraint solver.
  - Renamed JointLimitAvoidanceSolver to WLN_JointLimitAvoidanceSolver
  - WLN_JointLimitAvoidanceSolver inherits from WeightedLeastNormSolver and implements calculate_weighting only. -> Solving is done by the WLN Solver.
* Added validation outputs.
  Added comments for doxygen generation.
  Did some renaming.
* Made restructured changes active.
  Corrected some implementation.
  Activated both old and new implementation for comparison and testing purposes.
* Made usages of ConstraintSolverFactoryBuilder:
  - Creates DampingMethod
  - Creates ConstraintSolver
  - Executes calculation of joint velocities.
* Split up augmented_solver.cpp into different constraint solvers: JLA constraints and unconstraint.
* - Restructured augmented_solver.
  - Renamed class augmented_solver to AugmentedSolver.
  - Created damping_methods as classes to ease creation of dampings (and new ones).
